### Lattice Multiplication

* Draw the rectangle
* Draw the factors
* Calculate all digit * digit values inside the rectangle
* Tens goes to the upper left corner of each cell
* Ones goes to the lower right corner
* Sum the diagonals, start with lower right corner
* The bottom line will contain the result

#### Example 19 x 8

#### 19 x 8, step by step

* The rectangle is two cells wide, one cell high
* Draw 19
* Draw 8
* 1*8 = 8
* 9*8 = 72
* The sum of the last stripe is 2. Go left and down
* The middle stripe is 15. 1 goes to the next stripe
* The first stripe is 1
* The result of 19 x 8 is 80 + 72 = 152

### Example 345 x 67 = 23115

### Novelties

* I divide each cell into four subcells
* I put the carry digits in their proper positions
