## Investigation of rune.js

http://runemadsen.github.io/rune.js/documentation.html#runevector

Looks like a solid alternative to p5.js

But, it had some issues:

* mouse events did not respond
* no arc a la p5
* stagepos did not consider rotations
* no contains for
  * rect
  * circle
  * ellipse
  * triangle
* rudimentary tests
