This complete set of 52 playing card faces (plus two jokers) is based off the 
standard set dating  back to the late 1900's and in use in most modern decks 
today. The cards were initially scanned from a real deck at 600 DPI and then 
auto traced with Inkscape ( www.inkscape.org ) as a starting point. Nearly every
line/node was redrawn from this initial starting point and then optimized to 
decrease file size and create cleaner curves, sharper transitions, etc. 

For .SVG capable editors (Inkscape and Illustrator CS2 tested)the cards are 
offered as complete sets of 52 (full color, gray-scale, and high contrast B/W). 
All three of those sets are also offered in Illustrator .eps format. A file 
containing various card elements (pips, numbers,etc.) is included for those for 
those who need to use those discrete vectors. 

Since these vectors were created for and optimized for use in Inkscape in .SVG 
format,it's my recommendation to use that program in conjunction with these 
vectors.

For Release 2.0 many new simple pattern backs and specialized card faces sets 
have been created, but these require the use of Inkscape.

A small set of ESP cards added.
