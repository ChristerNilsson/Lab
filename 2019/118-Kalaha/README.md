Click on the lower six houses.

### Rules
1. The game begins with one player picking up all of the pieces in any one of the pockets on his/her side.
2. Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the stones in each pocket until the stones run out.
3. If you run into your own Mancala (store), deposit one piece in it. If you run into your opponent's Mancala, skip it and
 continue moving to the next pocket.
4. If the last piece you drop is in your own Mancala, you take another turn.
5. If the last piece you drop is in an empty pocket on your side, you capture that piece and any pieces in the pocket directly
opposite.
6. Always place all captured pieces in your Mancala (store).
7. The game ends when all six pockets on one side of the Mancala board are empty.
8. The player who still has pieces on his/her side of the board when the game ends captures all of those pieces.
9. Count all the pieces in each Mancala. The winner is the player with the most pieces.

Q: What happens if exactly 13 stones are moved? A: Put in your starting pit. 

Space = new game with same number of beans

1..9 = New game with other number of beans.
