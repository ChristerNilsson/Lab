Click on the lower six pits.

### Rules
1. The game begins with one player picking up all of the stones in any one of the pits on his side.
2. Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the stones in each pit until the stones run out.
3. If you run into your own Mancala (store), deposit one stone in it. If you run into your opponent's Mancala, skip it and
 continue moving to the next pit.
4. If the last stone you drop is in your own Mancala, you take another turn.
5. If the last stone you drop is in an empty pit on your side, you capture that stone and any stones in the pit directly
opposite.
6. Always place all captured stones in your Mancala (store).
7. The game ends when all six pits on one side of the Mancala board are empty.
8. The player who still has stones on his side of the board when the game ends captures all of those stones.
9. Count all the stones in each Mancala. The winner is the player with the most stones.

* Q: What happens if exactly 13 stones are moved?
