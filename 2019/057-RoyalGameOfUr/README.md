### P Cells (Promotion)

Cells with a Single Set of 5 Dots are located in the two corners of the smaller block. Once a piece leaves that cell and either lands on or crosses cell B8 it flips over from the blank side to the dotted side. While the piece sits inside a cell with a Single Set of Five Dots it does not flip over.

### R Cells (One Extra Move)

If a piece lands on a cell with Rosette it gets a second turn in a row. However, the player is not required to move that exact piece the second time, but rather can move any of his pieces that are already placed on the board, or place a new piece onto the board.
A piece that lands onto a cell with Rosette can knock off the opponent’s piece that was already sitting there, and if it does the player that made the move gets a second turn.

### I Cell (Safe for promoted)

There is only one cell with 12 Dots on the board and that is the last cell on the path – B1. That cell is a safe cell only at the end of the path, meaning that a dotted piece that landed on it cannot be knocked off for any reason. However, a blank piece that is still in the beginning of the path can be knocked off off of it.
The cell with 12 Dots can be occupied only by a single piece. All pieces, dotted or blank, same player’s, or opponent’s, are not allowed to stack on top of this cell.

### S Cells (Stack upto 4. Same player)

Pieces that belong to the same player that land on a cell with 4 Eyes can stack on top of each other up to 4 pieces. Note that the pieces stack on the same cell only if they belong to the same player. If the cell is already taken by the opponent’s piece or pieces then the other player’s piece cannot land there.
Cell B7, which is the first cell with 4 Eyes in the small block of the board is a switching stacking cell. This means that the player who landed on it first can stack up to 4 of their pieces on it and the opponent cannot knock them off the board or occupy that cell. However, the opponent can cross it to move in to following cells. Once all pieces leave cell B7, then it becomes no one’s and the other opponent can occupy it instead. The reason cell B7 behaves differently than other cells with 4 Eyes is because it is used to enter and exit the smaller block of the board without creating a traffic jam.

### M Cells (Stack upto 4. Mixed players)

Cells with Four Sets of Five Dots are safe cells. Any combination of 4 pieces can stack on it. The pieces can be the same player’s or opponents, and can be either dotted or blank.
The pieces can move off the cell with Four Sets of Five Dots only in the order that they were stacked, top down. The top piece moves off first, and only once that piece has left the next piece below it can move. As long as a piece has another piece on top of it it is blocked and cannot move off that cell.

### A Cells (Attack allowed)

Cells with 5 big dots do not have a special function.
