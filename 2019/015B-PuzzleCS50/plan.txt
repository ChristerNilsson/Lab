things we need:
    a 2D array representing the board
    a solved 1-15 2D array representing the goal state
    a variable keeping track of the location of the empty space in the board
    a function to display the board on the screen
    board functions to make "moves"
    a keyboard listener so the user can interact with the game
    a function that solves the game for us
    a "game over" screen
