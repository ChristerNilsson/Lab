## Keys

* ESC = quit
* Four Arrow Keys 
* shift = solve

## Goal

    A B C D
    E F G H
    I J K L 
    M N O â€¢
    
## Critic

* Creating a problem with shuffle() does not consider
  * Leaving the 4x4 box
  * Undoing a previous move
  * This makes the problem a lot easier as the solution will be shorter.
  
* Making the variable searched a dictionary instead of a list, increases speed.

* 1D board is quicker than a 2D. No deepcopy() needed.

* move_*() replaced by one function.

* function successors() simplified

* A* with a priority queue is needed if you want a speedy solution

* Variable fringe simplified. Everything stored in Board now.

* Binary tree shown in video is not relevant for explaining a simple queue. No heap used.

* There is no reason to store the constant goal in each and every Board instance.

## Changes:

* Using letters A-O instead of 1-15
