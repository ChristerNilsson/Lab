# Guess My Number

[Try it!](https://christernilsson.github.io/Lab/2019/065-GuessMyNumberInterval)

Guess the number in the interval!

If you use steps less than or equal to level, you will reach the next level!

The probability tells the expected number of steps needed.

Example:

Interval: 1-3

* 1 Takes two steps
* 2 Takes one step
* 3 Takes two steps

(2+1+2)/3 = 5/3 = 1.667
