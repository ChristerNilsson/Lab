# LUNAR AND SOLAR EPHEMERIDES SUBROUTINES
#
# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
#
#	THESE SUBROUTINES ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE POSITION AND VELOCITY
#	VECTORS OF THE SUN AND THE MOON RELATIVE TO THE EARTH AT THE
#	SPECIFIED GROUND ELAPSED TIME INPUT BY THE USER.
#
#	THE POSITION OF THE MOON IS STORED IN THE COMPUTER IN THE FORM OF
#	A NINTH DEGREE POLYNOMIAL APPROXIMATION WHICH IS VALID OVER A 15
#	DAY INTERVAL BEGINNING SHORTLY BEFORE LAUNCH.  THEREFORE THE TIME
#	INPUT BY THE USER SHOULD FALL WITHIN THIS 15 DAY INTERVAL.
##	The 9th-degree polynomial spoken of here is a pad load, meaning
##	that it is not actually hardcoded into the software.  Additional
##	information about calculating the polynomial can be found on the
##	<a href="http://nassp.sourceforge.net/wiki/Lunar_Ephemeris_Polynomials">
##	<b>Orbiter</b> NASSP wiki</a>, as well as information about calculation
##	of the <a href="http://nassp.sourceforge.net/wiki/Solar_Ephemeris">
##	solar ephemerides</a>.
#
#	LSPOS COMPUTES THE POSITION VECTORS OF THE SUN AND THE MOON.
#
#	LUNPOS COMPUTES THE POSITION VECTOR OF THE MOON.
#
#	LUNVEL COMPUTES THE VELOCITY VECTOR OF THE MOON.
#
#	SOLPOS COMPUTES THE POSITION VECTOR OF THE SUN.

#
# INPUT
#
#	1) SPECIFIED GROUND ELAPSED TIME IN CS x B-28 LOADED IN MPAC.
#
#	2) TIMEMO -- TIME AT THE CENTER OF THE RANGE OVER WHICH THE LUNAR
#	POSITION POLYNOMIAL IS VALID IN CS x B-42.
#
#	3) VECOEM -- VECTOR COEFFICIENTS OF THE LUNAR POSITION POLYNOMIAL
#	LOADED IN DESCENDING SEQUENCE IN METERS/CS**N x B-2
#
#	4) RESO -- POSITION VECTOR OF THE SUN RELATIVE TO THE EARTH AT
#	TIMEMO IN METERS x B-38
#
#	5) VESO -- VELOCITY VECTOR OF THE SUN RELATIVE TO THE EARTH AT
#	TIMEMO IN METERS/CS x B-9
#
#	6) OMEGAES -- ANGULAR VELOCITY OF THE VECTOR RESO AT TIMEMO IN
#	REV/CS x B+26
#
#	ALL EXCEPT THE FIRST INPUT ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRE-LAUNCH
#	ERASABLE DATA LOAD.
#
# OUTPUT -- LSPOS
# Page 786
#
#	1) 2D OF VAC AREA CONTAINS THE POSITION VECTOR OF THE SUN RELATIVE
#	TO THE EARTH AT TIME INPUT BY THE USER IN METERS x B-38.
#
#	2) MPAC CONTAINS THE POSITION VECTOR OF THE MOON RELATIVE TO THE
#	EARTH AT TIME INPUT BY THE USER IN METERS x B-29
#
# OUTPUT -- LUNPOS
#
#	MPAC CONTAINS THE POSITION VECTOR OF THE MOON RELATIVE TO THE
#	EARTH AT THE TIME INPUT BY USER IN METERS x B-29
#
# OUTPUT -- LUNVEL
#
#	MPAC CONTAINS THE VELOCITY VECTOR OF THE MOON RELATIVE TO THE
#	EARTH AT THE TIME INPUT BY THE USER IN METERS/CS x B-7
#
# OUTPUT -- SOLPOS
#
#	MPAC CONTAINS THE POSITION VECTOR OF THE SUN RELATIVE TO THE EARTH
#	AT TIME INPUT BY THE USER IN METERS x B-38.
#
# SUBROUTINES USED
#
#	NONE
#
# REMARKS
#
#	THE VAC AREA IS USED FOR STORAGE OF INTERMEDIATE AND FINAL RESULTS
#	OF COMPUTATIONS.
#
#	S1, X1, AND X2 ARE USED BY THESE SUBROUTINES.
#
#	PRELAUNCH ERASABLE DATA LOAD ARE ONLY ERASABLE STORAGE USED BY
#	THESE SUBROUTINES.
#
#	RESTARTS DURING OPERATION OF THESE SUBROUTINES MUST BE HANDLED BY
#	THE USER.
