# Filename:	SERVICE_ROUTINES.agc
# Purpose: 	Part of the source code for Luminary 1A build 099.
#		It is part of the source code for the Lunar Module's (LM)
#		Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC), for Apollo 11.
# Assembler:	yaYUL
# Contact:	Ron Burkey <info@sandroid.org>.
# Website:	www.ibiblio.org/apollo.
# Pages:	1374-1380
# Mod history:  2009-05-10 SN   (Sergio Navarro).  Started adapting
#				from the Luminary131/ file of the same
#				name, using Luminary099 page images.
#
# This source code has been transcribed or otherwise adapted from
# digitized images of a hardcopy from the MIT Museum.  The digitization
# was performed by Paul Fjeld, and arranged for by Deborah Douglas of
# the Museum.  Many thanks to both.  The images (with suitable reduction
# in storage size and consequent reduction in image quality as well) are
# available online at www.ibiblio.org/apollo.  If for some reason you
# find that the images are illegible, contact me at info@sandroid.org
# about getting access to the (much) higher-quality images which Paul
# actually created.

# UPFLAG AND DOWNFLAG ARE ENTIRELY GENERAL FLAG SETTING AND CLEARING SUBROUTINES.  USING THEM, WHETHER OR
# NOT IN INTERRUPT, ONE MAY SET OR CLEAR ANY SINGLE, NAMED BIT IN ANY ERASABLE REGISTER, SUBJECT OF COURSE TO
# EBANK SETTING.  A "NAMED" BIT, AS THE WORD IS USED HERE, IS ANY BIT WITH A NAME FORMALLY ASSIGNED BY THE YUL
# ASSEMBLER.
#
# AT PRESENT THE ONLY NAMED BITS ARE THOSE IN THE FLAGWORDS.  ASSEMBLER CHANGES WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO
# NAME ANY BIT IN ERASABLE MEMORY.
#
# CALLING SEQUENCES ARE AS FOLLOWS :-
#		TC	UPFLAG			TC	DOWNFLAG
#		ADRES	NAME OF FLAG		ADRES	NAME OF FLAG
#
# RETURN IS TO THE LOCATION FOLLOWING THE "ADRES" ABOUT .58 MS AFTER THE "TC".
# UPON RETURN A CONTAINS THE CURRENT FLAGWRD SETTING.
