# This source code has been transcribed or otherwise adapted from
# digitized images of a hardcopy from the MIT Museum.  The digitization
# was performed by Paul Fjeld, and arranged for by Deborah Douglas of
# the Museum.  Many thanks to both.  The images (with suitable reduction
# in storage size and consequent reduction in image quality as well) are
# available online at www.ibiblio.org/apollo.  If for some reason you
# find that the images are illegible, contact me at info@sandroid.org
# about getting access to the (much) higher-quality images which Paul
# actually created.
