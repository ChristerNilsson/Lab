# This source code has been transcribed or otherwise adapted from
# digitized images of a hardcopy from the MIT Museum.  The digitization
# was performed by Paul Fjeld, and arranged for by Deborah Douglas of
# the Museum.  Many thanks to both.  The images (with suitable reduction
# in storage size and consequent reduction in image quality as well) are
# available online at www.ibiblio.org/apollo.  If for some reason you
# find that the images are illegible, contact me at info@sandroid.org
# about getting access to the (much) higher-quality images which Paul
# actually created.

# SUBROUTINE NAMES:
#	SETMAXDB, SETMINDB, RESTORDB, PFLITEDB
# MODIFIED:	30 JANUARY 1968 BY P. S. WEISSMAN TO CREATE RESTORDB.
# MODIFIED:	1 MARCH 1968 BY P. S. WEISSMAN TO SAVE EBANK AND CREATE PFLITEDB
#
# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
#	SETMAXDB -- SET DEADBAND TO 5.0 DEGREES
#	SETMINDB -- SET DEADBAND TO 0.3 DEGREE
#	RESTORDB -- SET DEADBAND TO MAX OR MIN ACCORDING TO SETTINGS OF DBSELECT BIT OF DAPBOOLS
#	PFLITEDB -- SET DEADBAND TO 1.0 DEGREE AND ZERO THE COMMANDED ATTITUDE CHANGE AND COMMANDED RATE
#
#	ALL ENTRIES SET UP A NOVAC JOB TO DO 1/ACCS SO THAT THE TJETLAW SWITCH CURVES ARE POSITIONED TO
#	REFLECT THE NEW DEADBAND.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE DEADBAND REFERS TO THE ATTITUDE IN THE P-, U-, AND V-AXES.
