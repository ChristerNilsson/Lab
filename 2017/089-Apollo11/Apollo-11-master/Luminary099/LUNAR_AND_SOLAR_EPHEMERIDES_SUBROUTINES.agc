# NAME -- LSPOS -- LOCATE SUN AND MOON			DATE -- 25 OCT 67
# MOD NO. 1
# MOD BY NEVILLE					ASSEMBLY SUNDANCE
#
# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
#
# COMPUTES UNIT POSITION VECTOR OF THE SUN AND MOON IN THE BASIC REFERENCE SYSTEM.  THE SUN VECTOR S IS
# LOCATED VIA TWO ANGLES.  THE FIRST ANGLE (OBLIQUITY) IS THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE EARTH EQUATOR AND THE ECLIPTIC.  THE
# POSITION VECTOR OF THE SUN IS
#	_
#	S = (COS(LOS), COS(OBL)*SIN(LOS), SIN(OBL)*SIN(LOS)), WHERE
#
#	LOS = LOS +LOS *T-(C *SIN(2PI*T)/365.24 +C *COS(2PI*T)/365.24)
#	         0    R     0                     1
#	LOS  (RAD) IS THE LONGITUDE OF THE SUN FOR MIGNIGHT JUNE 30TH OF THE PARTICULAR YEAR.
#          0
#	LOS  (RAD/DAY) IS THE MEAN RATE FOR THE PARTICULAR YEAR.
#    	   R
#
# LOS  AND LOS  ARE STORED AS LOSC AND LOSR IN RATESP.
#    0        R
# COS(OBL) AND SIN(OBL) ARE STORED IN THE MATRIX KONMAT.
#
# T, TIME MEASURED IN DAYS (24 HOURS) IS STORED IN TIMEP.
#
# C  AND C  ARE FUDGE FACTORS TO MINIMIZE THE DEVIATION.  THEY ARE STORED AS ONE CONSTANT (CMOD), SINCE
#  0      1                               2  2 1/2
# C *SIN(X)+C *COS(X) CAN BE WRITTEN AS (C +C )   *SIN(X+PHI), WHERE PHI=ARCTAN(C /C ).

#
# THE MOON IS LOCATED VIA FOUR ANGLES, THE FIRST IS THE OBLIQUITY. THE SECOND IS THE MEAN LONGITUDE OF THE MOON,
# MEASURED IN THE ECLIPTIC FROM THE MEAN EQUINOX TO THE MEAN ASCENDING NODE OF THE LUNAR ORBIT, AND THEN ALONG THE
# ORBIT.  THE THIRD ANGLE IS THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE ECLIPTIC AND THE LUNAR ORBIT.  THE FOURTH ANGLE IS THE LONGITUDE
# OF THE NODE OF THE MOON, MEASURED IN THE LUNAR ORBIT.  LET THESE ANGLES BE OBL,LOM,IM, AND LON RESPECTIVELY.
#
# THE SIMPLIFIED POSITION VECTOR OF THE MOON IS
#	_
#	M=(COS(LOM), COS(OBL)*SIN(LOM)-SIN(OBL)*SIN(IM)*SIN(LOM-LON), SIN(OBL)*SIN(LOM)+COS(OBL)*SIN(IM)*SIN(LOM-LON))
#
# WHERE
#	LOM=LOM +LOM *T-(A *SIN(2PI*T/27.5545)+A *COS(2PI*T/27.5545)+B *SIN(2PI*T/32)+B *COS(2PI*T/32)), AND

# A , A , B  AND B  ARE STORE AS AMOD AND BMOD (SEE DESCRIPTION OF CMOD, ABOVE).  COS(OBL), SIN(OBL)*SIN(IM),
#  0   1   0      1
