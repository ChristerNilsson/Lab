# Filename:	ALARM_AND_ABORT.agc
# Purpose: 	Part of the source code for Luminary 1A build 099.
#		It is part of the source code for the Lunar Module's (LM)
#		Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC), for Apollo 11.
# Assembler:	yaYUL
# Contact:	Ron Burkey <info@sandroid.org>.
# Website:	www.ibiblio.org/apollo.
# Pages:	1381-1385
# Mod history:  2009-05-10 SN   (Sergio Navarro).  Started adapting
#				from the Luminary131/ file of the same
#				name, using Luminary099 page images.
#		2009-06-05 RSB	Fixed a type.
#		2011-01-06 JL	Fixed pseudo-label indentation.
#
# This source code has been transcribed or otherwise adapted from
# digitized images of a hardcopy from the MIT Museum.  The digitization
# was performed by Paul Fjeld, and arranged for by Deborah Douglas of
# the Museum.  Many thanks to both.  The images (with suitable reduction
# in storage size and consequent reduction in image quality as well) are
# available online at www.ibiblio.org/apollo.  If for some reason you
# find that the images are illegible, contact me at info@sandroid.org
# about getting access to the (much) higher-quality images which Paul
# actually created.
