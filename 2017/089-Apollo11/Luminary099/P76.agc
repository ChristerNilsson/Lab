# This source code has been transcribed or otherwise adapted from
# digitized images of a hardcopy from the MIT Museum.  The digitization
# was performed by Paul Fjeld, and arranged for by Deborah Douglas of
# the Museum.  Many thanks to both.  The images (with suitable reduction
# in storage size and consequent reduction in image quality as well) are
# available online at www.ibiblio.org/apollo.  If for some reason you
# find that the images are illegible, contact me at info@sandroid.org
# about getting access to the (much) higher-quality images which Paul
# actually created.

# Page 709
# 1)	PROGRAM NAME -- TARGET DELTA V PROGRAM (P76).
# 2)	FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION -- UPON ENTRY BY ASTRONAUT ACTION, P76 FLASHES DSKY REQUESTS TO THE ASTRONAUT
#	TO PROVIDE VIA DSKY (1) THE DELTA V TO BE APPLIED TO THE OTHER VEHICLE STATE VECTOR AND (2) THE
#	TIME (TIG) AT WHICH THE OTHER VEHICLE VELOCITY WAS CHANGED BY EXECUTION OF A THRUSTING MANEUVER. THE
#	OTHER VEHICLE STATE VECTOR IS INTEGRATED TO TIG AND UPDATED BY THE ADDITION OF DELTA V (DELTA V HAVING
#	BEEN TRANSFORMED FROM LV TO REF COSYS).  USING INTEGRVS, THE PROGRAM THEN INTEGRATES THE OTHER
#	VEHICLE STATE VECTOR TO THE STATE VECTOR OF THIS VEHICLE, THUS INSURING THAT THE W-MATRIX AND BOTH VEHICLE
#	STATES CORRESPOND TO THE SAME TIME.
# 3)	ERASABLE INIITIALIZATION REQUIRED -- NONE.
# 4)	CALLING SEQUENCES AND EXIT MODES -- CALLED BY ASTRONAUT REQUEST THRU DSKY V 37 E 76E.
#	EXITS BY TCF ENDOFJOB.
# 5)	OUTPUT -- OTHER VEHICLE STATE VECTOR INTEGRATED TO TIG AND INCREMENTED BY DELTA V IN REF COSYS.
#	THE PUSHLIST CONTAINS THE MATRIX BY WHICH THE INPUT DELTA V MUST BE POST-MULTIPLIED TO CONVERT FROM LV
#	TO REF COSYS.
# 6)	DEBRIS -- OTHER VEHICLE STATE VECTOR.
# 7)	SUBROUTINES CALLED -- BANKCALL, GOXDSPF, CSMPREC (OR LEMPREC), ATOPCSM (OR ATOPLEM), INTSTALL, INTWAKE, PHASCHNG
#	INTPRET, INTEGRVS, AND MINIRECT.
# 8)	FLAG USE -- MOONFLAG, CMOONFLG, INTYPFLG, RASFLAG, AND MARKCTR.
