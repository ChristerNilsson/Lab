# This source code has been transcribed or otherwise adapted from
# digitized images of a hardcopy from the MIT Museum.  The digitization
# was performed by Paul Fjeld, and arranged for by Deborah Douglas of
# the Museum.  Many thanks to both.  The images (with suitable reduction
# in storage size and consequent reduction in image quality as well) are
# available online at www.ibiblio.org/apollo.  If for some reason you
# find that the images are illegible, contact me at info@sandroid.org
# about getting access to the (much) higher-quality images which Paul
# actually created.

# PROGRAM NAME:  AGS INITIALIZATION (R47)
#
# WRITTEN BY:  RHODE/KILROY/FOLLETT
#
# MOD NO.:	0

# MOD BY:	FOLLETT
#
# FUNCT. DESC.:	(1) TO PROVIDE THE AGS ABORT ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLY (AEA) WITH THE LEM AND CSM STATE VECTORS
#		(POSITION,VELOCITY,TIME) IN LEM IMU COORDINATES BY MEANS OF THE LGC DIGITAL DOWNLINK.
#
#		(2) TO ZERO THE ICDU, LGC, AND AEA GIMBAL ANGLE COUNTER SIMULTANEOUSLY IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A
#		COMMON ZERO REFERENCE FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF GIMBAL (EULER) ANGLES WHICH DEFINE LEM ATTITUDE
#
#		(3) TO ESTABLISH THE GROUND ELAPSED TIME OF AEA CLOCK ZERO.  (IF AN AEA CLOCK ZERO IS
#		REQUESTED DURING THIS PROGRAM
#
# LOG SECTION:	AGS INITIALIZATION
#
# CALLING SEQ:	PROGRAM IS ENTERED WHEN ASTRONAUT KEYS V47E ON DSKY.
#		R47 MAY BE CALLED AT ANY TIME EXCEPT WHEN ANOTHER EXTENDED VERB IS IN PROGRESS
#
# SUBROUTINES
# CALLED:
#
# NORMAL EXIT:	ENDEXT
#
# ALARM/ABORT:	ALARM -- BAD REFSMMAT -- CODE:220
#		OPERATOR ERROR IF V47 SELECTED DURING ANOTHER EXTENDED VERB.
#
# ERASABLES
# USED:		SAMPTIME	(2)	TIME OF :ENTER: KEYSTROKE
#		AGSK		(2)	GROUND ELAPSED TIME OF THE AEA CLOCK :ZERO:
#		AGSBUFF		(140)	CONTAINS AGS INITIALIZATION DATA (SEE :OUTPUT: BELOW)
#		AGSWORD		(1)	PREVIOUS DOWNLIST SAVED HERE
