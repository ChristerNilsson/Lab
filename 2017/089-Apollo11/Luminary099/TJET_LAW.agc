# PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
# DESIGNED BY:	R. D. GOSS AND P. S. WEISSMAN
# CODED BY:  P. S. WEISSMAN, 28 FEBRUARY 1968
#
# TJETLAW IS CALLED AS A SUBROUTINE WHEN THE LEM IS NOT DOCKED AND THE AUTOPILOT IS IN THE AUTOMATIC OR
# ATTITUDE-HOLD MODE TO CALCULATE THE JET-FIRING-TIME (TJET) REQUIRED FOR THE AXIS INDICATED BY AXISCTR:
#	-1	INDICATES THE P-AXIS
#	+0	INDICATES THE U-AXIS
#	+1	INDICATES THE V-AXIS
# THE REGISTERS E AND EDOT CONTAIN THE APPROPRIATE ATTITUDE ERROR AND ERROR RATE AND SENSETYP SHOWS WHETHER
# UNBALANCED COUPLES ARE PREFERRED.  TJETLAW ALSO USES VARIOUS FUNCTIONS OF ACCELERATION AND DEADBAND WHICH ARE
# COMPUTED IN THE 1/ACCONT SECTION OF 1/ACCS AND ARE STORED IN SUCH AN ORDER THAT THEY CAN BE CONVENIENTLY
# ACCESSED BY INDEXING.
#
# THE SIGN OF THE REQUIRED ROTATION IS CARRIED THROUGH TJETLAW AS ROTSENSE AND IS FINALLY APPLIED TO TJET JUST
# PREVIOUS TO ITS STORAGE IN THE LOCATION CORRESPONDING TO THE AXIS (TJP, TJU, OR TJV).  THE NUMBER OF JETS THAT
# TJETLAW ASSUMES WILL BE USED AS INDICATED BY THE SETTING OF NUMBERT FOR THE U- OR V-AXIS.  TWO JETS ARE ALWAYS
# ASSUMED FOR THE P-AXIS ALTHOUGH FOUR JETS WILL BE FIRED WHEN FIREFCT IS MORE NEGATIVE THAN -4.0 DEGREES
# (FIREFCT IS THE DISTANCE TO A SWITCH CURVE IN THE PHASE PLANE) AND A LONG FIRING IS CALLED FOR.
#
# IN ORDER TO AVOID SCALING DIFFICULTIES, SIMPLE ALGORITHMS TAGGED RUFLAW1, -2 AND -3 ARE RESORTED TO WHEN THE
# ERROR AND/OR ERROR RATE ARE LARGE.
#
# CALLING SEQUENCE:
