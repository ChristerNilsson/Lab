# Mod history:  2009-05-10 SN   (Sergio Navarro).  Started adapting
#                               from the Colossus249/ file of the same
#                               name, using Comanche055 page images.
#
# This source code has been transcribed or otherwise adapted from digitized
# images of a hardcopy from the MIT Museum.  The digitization was performed
# by Paul Fjeld, and arranged for by Deborah Douglas of the Museum.  Many
# thanks to both.  The images (with suitable reduction in storage size and
# consequent reduction in image quality as well) are available online at
# www.ibiblio.org/apollo.  If for some reason you find that the images are
# illegible, contact me at info@sandroid.org about getting access to the
# (much) higher-quality images which Paul actually created.
#
# Notations on the hardcopy document read, in part:

#    Assemble revision 055 of AGC program Comanche by NASA

#    This AGC program shall also be referred to as

# CDUTRIG, CDUTRIG1, CDUTRIG2, AND CD*GR*GS ALL COMPUTE THE SINES AND
# COSINES OF THREE 2'S COMPLEMENT ANGLES AND PLACE THE RESULT, DOUBLE
# PRECISION, IN THE SAME ORDER AS THE INPUTS, AT SINCDU AND COSCDU.  AN
# ADDITIONAL OUTPUT IS THE 1'S COMPLENT ANGLES AT CDUSPOT.  THESE
# ROUTINES GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO LEAVE THE MPAC AREA AS THEY FIND IT.
# EXCEPT FOR THE GENERALLY UNIMPORTANT MPAC +2.  THEY DIFFER ONLY IN
# WHERE THEY GET THE ANGLES, AND IN METHOD OF CALLING.
#
# CDUTRIG (AND CDUTRIG1, WHICH CAN BE CALLED IN BASIC) COMPUTE THE
# SINES AND COSINES FROM THE CURRENT CONTENTS OF THE CDU REGISTERS.
# THE CONTENTS OF CDUTEMP, ETC., ARE NOT TOUCHED SO THAT THEY MAY
# CONTINUE TO FORM A CONSISTENT SET WITH THE LATEST PIPA READINGS.
#
# CDUTRIG1 IS LIKE CDUTRIG EXCEPT THAT IT CAN BE CALLED IN BASIC.
#
# CD*TR*GS FINDS CDU VALUES IN CDUSPOT RATHER THAN IN CDUTEMP.  THIS
# ALLOWS USERS TO MAKE TRANSFORMATIONS USING ARBITRARY ANGLES, OR REAL
# ANGLES IN AN ORDER OTHER THAN X Y Z.  A CALL TO THIS ROUTINE IS
# NECESSARY IN PREPARATION FOR A CALL TO AX*SR*T IN EITHER OF ITS TWO
# MODES (SMNB OR NBSM).  SINCE AX*SR*T EXPECTS TO FIND THE SINES AND
# COSINES IN THE ORDER Y Z X THE ANGLES MUST HAVE BEEN PLACED IN CDUSPOT
# IN THIS ORDER.  CD*TR*GS NEED NOT BE REPEATED WHEN AX*SR*T IS CALLED
# MORE THAN ONCE, PROVIDED THE ANGLES HAVE NOT CHANGED.  NOTE THAT SINCE
# IT CLOBBERS BUF2 (IN THE SINE AND COSINE ROUTINES) CD*TR*GS CANNOT BE
# CALLED USING BANKCALL.  SORRY.
#
# CD*TR*G IS LIKE CD*TR*GS EXCEPT THAT IT CAN BE CALLED IN
# INTERPRETIVE.
