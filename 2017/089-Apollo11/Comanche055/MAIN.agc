# Mod history:	2009-05-05 RSB	Adapted from Colossus249/MAIN.agc.
#
# This source code has been transcribed or otherwise adapted from digitized
# images of a hardcopy from the MIT Museum.  The digitization was performed
# by Paul Fjeld, and arranged for by Deborah Douglas of the Museum.  Many
# thanks to both.  The images (with suitable reduction in storage size and
# consequent reduction in image quality as well) are available online at
# www.ibiblio.org/apollo.  If for some reason you find that the images are
# illegible, contact me at info@sandroid.org about getting access to the
# (much) higher-quality images which Paul actually created.

#	This AGC program shall also be referred to as
#			Colossus 2A
#
# This file is a little different from the other Comanche055 files I'm providing,
# in that it doesn't represent anything that appears directly in the original source.
# What I (RSB) have done for organizational purposes is to split the huge monolithic
# source code into smaller, more manageable chunks--i.e., into individual source
# files.  Those files are rejoined within this file as "includes".  It just makes
# it a little easier to work with.  The code chunks correspond to natural divisions
# into sub-programs.  In fact, these divisions are more-or-less specified by
# the source code itself.  Refer to the "SUBROUTINE CALLS" at the
# very beginning of the file ASSEMBLY_AND_OPERATION_INFORMATION.agc.
#
# It may be reasonably asked why tens of thousands of lines of source are joined by
# means of inclusion, rather than simply assembling the source files individually and
# then linking them to form the executable.  The answer is that the original
# development team had no linker.  The builds were monolithic just like this.
# There was a big emphasis on reusability of the code in the original project,
# apparently, but this reusability took the form of inserting your deck of
# punch-cards at the appropriate position in somebody else's deck of punch-cards.
# (Actually, I think the card-decks were turned into tape libraries, and the modules
# were mixed-and-matched from the tape libraries, but the principle is the same.)
# So, indeed, the method of file-inclusion is a very fair representation of the
# methods used in the original development ... with the improvement, of course,
# that you no longer have to worry about dropping the card deck.  On the other hand,
# I wasn't there at the time, so I may have no idea what I'm talking about.
#
# Finally, note that the original Apollo AGC assembler (called "YUL") is no longer
# available (as far as I can tell).  Actually, it had already been replaced by another
# assembler (called "GAP") by the time of Apollo 11, but GAP isn't available either.
# The replacement assembler yaYUL accepts a slightly different format for the source
# code from what YUL or GAP accepted, so the source code has been targeted for
# assembly with yaYUL.

# What follows is simply a bunch of file-includes for the individual code chunks.
# I've marked the page numbers to make proof-reading easier.  The page images also
# contain a lot of interesting tables (cross-referenced to page numbers) created by GAP,
# but not duplicated by yaYUL, so it's still valuable even if the source-files
# listed below are in hand.
