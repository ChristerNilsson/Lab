# Purpose:	Part of the source code for Colossus 2A, AKA Comanche 055.
#		It is part of the source code for the Command Module's (CM)
#		Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC), for Apollo 11.
# Assembler:	yaYUL

# Website:	www.ibiblio.org/apollo.
# Pages:	936-944
# Mod history:	2009-05-11 JVL	Adapted from the Colossus249/ file
#				of the same name, using Comanche055 page
#				images.
#		2009-05-20 RSB	Corrections:  +80 -> +8D, added 4 missing
#				lines in TVCINIT1, changed the capitalization
#				of a couple of the "Page N" comments,
#				corrected a couple of lines in LOADCOEFF.
#		2009-05-22 RSB	In LOADCOEF, DXCH N10 +14D corrected to
#				TS N10 +14D.  Also, various comment-marks
#				were added to comments following this
#				change.

# This source code has been transcribed or otherwise adapted from digitized
# images of a hardcopy from the MIT Museum.  The digitization was performed
# by Paul Fjeld, and arranged for by Deborah Douglas of the Museum.  Many
# thanks to both.  The images (with suitable reduction in storage size and
# consequent reduction in image quality as well) are available online at
# www.ibiblio.org/apollo.  If for some reason you find that the images are
# illegible, contact me at info@sandroid.org about getting access to the
# (much) higher-quality images which Paul actually created.

# NAME		TVCDAPON (TVC DAP INITIALIZATION AND STARTUP CALL)
# LOG SECTION...TVCINITIALIZE			SUBROUTINE...DAPCSM
# MODIFIED BY SCHLUNDT				21 OCTOBER 1968
# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
#	PERFORMS TVCDAP INITIALIZATION (GAINS, TIMING PARAMETERS, FILTER VARIABLES, ETC.)
#	COMPUTES STEERING (S40.8) GAIN KPRIMEDT, AND ZEROES PASTDELV,+1 VARIABLE
#	MAKES INITIALIZATION CALL TO "NEEDLER" FOR TVC DAP NEEDLES-SETUP
#	PERFORMS INITIALIZATION FOR ROLL DAP
#	CALLS TVCEXECUTIVE AT TVCEXEC, VIA WAITLIST
#	CALLS TVCDAP CDU-RATE INITIALIZATION PKG AT DAPINIT  VIA T5
#	PROVIDES FOR LOADING OF LOW-BANDWIDTH COEFFS AND GAINS AT SWICHOVR
# CALLING SEQUENCE - T5LOC=2CADR(TVCDAPON,EBANK=BZERO), T5=.6SECT5
#	IN PARTICULAR, CALLED BY "DOTVCON" IN P40
#	MRCLEAN AND TVCINIT4 ARE POSSIBLE TVC-RESTART ENTRY POINTS
# NORMAL EXIT MODE
#	TCF RESUME
# SUBROUTINES CALLED
#	NEEDLER, MASSPROP
# ALARM OR ABORT EXIT MODES
#	NONE
# ERASABLE INITIALIZATION REQUIRED
#	CSMMASS, LEMMASS, DAPDATR1 (FOR MASSPROP SUBROUTINE)
#	TVC PAD LOADS (SEE EBANK6 IN ERASABLE ASSIGNMENTS)
#	PACTOFF, YACTOFF, CDUX
#	TVCPHASE AND THE T5 BITS OF FLAGWRD6 (SET AT DOTVCON IN P40)
# OUTPUT
#	ALL TVC AND ROLL DAP ERASABLES, FLAGWRD6 (BITS 13,14), T5, WAITLIST
# DEBRIS
#	NONE
