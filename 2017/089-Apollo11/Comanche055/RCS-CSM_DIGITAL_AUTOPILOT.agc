# consequent reduction in image quality as well) are available online at
# www.ibiblio.org/apollo.  If for some reason you find that the images are
# illegible, contact me at info@sandroid.org about getting access to the
# (much) higher-quality images which Paul actually created.

# RCS-CSM AUTOPILOT ATTITUDE ERROR DISPLAY
#
# THREE TYPES OF ATTITUDE ERRORS MAY BE DISPLAYED ON THE FDAI:
#
#	MODE 1)	AUTOPILOT FOLLOWING ERRORS		SELECTED BY V61E
#		GENERATED INTERNALLY BY THE AUTOPILOT
#
#	MODE 2)	TOTAL ATTITUDE ERRORS			SELECTED BY V62E
#		WITH RESPECT TO THE CONTENTS OF N22
#
#	MODE 3)	TOTAL ASTRONAUT ATTITUDE ERRORS		SELECTED BY V63E
#		WITH RESPECT TO THE CONTENTS OF N17
#
# MODE 1 IS PROVIDED AS A MONITOR OF THE RCS DAP AND ITS ABILITY TO TRACK AUTOMATIC STEERING COMMANDS.  IN THIS
# MODE THE ATTITUDE ERRORS WILL BE ZEROED WHEN THE CMC MODE SWITCH IS IN FREE.
#
# MODE 2 IS PROVIDED TO ASSIST THE CREW IN MANUALLY MANEUVERING THE S/C TO THE ATTITUDE (GIMBAL ANGLES) SPECIFIED
# IN N22.  THE ATTITUDE ERRORS WRT THESE ANGLES AND THE CURRENT CDU ANGLES ARE RESOLVED INTO S/C CONTROL AXES
# AS A FLY-TO INDICATOR.
#
# MODE 3 IS PROVIDED TO ASSIST THE CREW IN MANUALLY MANEUVERING THE S/C TO THE ATTITUDE (GIMBAL ANGLES) SPECIFIED
# IN N17.  THE ATTITUDE ERRORS WRT THESE ANGLES AND THE CURRENT CDU ANGLES ARE RESOLVED INTO S/C CONTROL AXES
# AS A FLY-TO INDICATOR.
#
# V60 IS PROVIDED TO LOAD N17 WITH A SNAPSHOT OF THE CURRENT CDU ANGLES, THUS SYNCHRONIZING THE MODE 3 DISPLAY
# WITH THE CURRENT S/C ATTITUDE.  THIS VERB MAY BE USED AT ANY TIME.
#
# THESE DISPLAYS WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ANY MODE (AUTO, HOLD, FREE, G+N, OR SCS) ONCE THE RCS DAP HAS BEEN
# INITIATED VIA V46E.  MODE 1, HOWEVER, WILL BE MEANINGFUL ONLY IN G+N AUTO OR HOLD.  THE CREW MAY PRESET (VIA
# V25N17) AN ATTITUDE REFERENCE (DESIRED GIMBAL ANGLES) INTO N17 AT ANY TIME.

# FDAI ATTITUDE ERROR DISPLAY SUBROUTINE
#
# PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:	D. KEENE  5/24/67
#
# THIS SUBROUTINE IS USED TO DISPLAY ATTITUDE ERRORS ON THE FDAI VIA THE DIGITAL TO ANALOG CONVERTERS (DACS)
# IN THE CDUS.  CARE IS TAKEN TO METER OUT THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF PULSES TO THE IMU ERROR COUNTERS AND PREVENT
# OVERFLOW, TO CONTROL THE RELAY SEQUENCING, AND TO AVOID INTERFERENCE WITH THE COARSE ALIGN LOOP WHICH ALSO USES
# THE DACS.
#
# CALLING SEQUENCE:
#
# DURING THE INITIALIZATION SECTION OF THE USER'S PROGRAM, BIT3 OF RCSFLAGS SHOULD BE SET TO INITIATE THE
# TURN-ON SEQUENCE WITHIN THE NEEDLES PROGRAM:
#
#		CS	RCSFLAGS	# IN EBANK6
#		MASK	BIT3
#		ADS	RCSFLAGS
#
# THEREAFTER, THE ATTITUDE ERRORS GENERATED BY THE USER SHOULD BE TRANSFERED TO THE FOLLOWING LOCATIONS IN EBANK6:
#
#		AK	SCALED 180 DEGREES	NOTE:	THESE LOCATIONS ARE SUBJECT
#		AK1	SCALED 180 DEGREES		TO CHANGE
#		AK2	SCALED 180 DEGREES
#
# FULL SCALED DEFLECTION CORRESPONDS TO 16 7/8 DEGREES OF ATTITUDE ERROR
#		(= 384 BITS IN IMU ERROR COUNTER)
#
# A CALL TO NEEDLER WILL THEN UPDATE THE DISPLAY:
#
#		INHINT
#		TC	IBNKCALL	# NOTE: EBANK SHOULD BE SET TO E6
#		CADR	NEEDLER
#		RELINT
#
# THIS PROCESS SHOULD BE REPEATED EACH TIME THE ERRORS ARE UPDATED.  AT LEAST 3 PASSES THRU THE PRORAM ARE
# REQUIRED BEFORE ANYTHING IS ACTUALLY DISPLAYED ON THE ERROR METERS.
# NOTE:  EACH CALL TO NEEDLER MUST BE SEPARATED BY AT LEAST 50MS TO ASSURE PROPER RELAY SEQUENCING.
