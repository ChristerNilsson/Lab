# This source code has been transcribed or otherwise adapted from digitized
# images of a hardcopy from the MIT Museum.  The digitization was performed
# by Paul Fjeld, and arranged for by Deborah Douglas of the Museum.  Many
# thanks to both.  The images (with suitable reduction in storage size and
# consequent reduction in image quality as well) are available online at
# www.ibiblio.org/apollo.  If for some reason you find that the images are
# illegible, contact me at info@sandroid.org about getting access to the
# (much) higher-quality images which Paul actually created.

# PROGRAM NAME....MASSPROP
# LOG SECTION....TVCMASSPROP		PROGRAMMER...MELANSON (ENGEL, SCHLUNDT)
#
# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
#
#	MASSPROP OPERATES IN TWO MODES: (1) IF LEM MASS OR CONFIGURATION ARE UPDATED (MASSPROP DOES NOT TEST
#	FOR THIS) THE ENTIRE PROGRAM MUST BE RUN THROUGH, BREAKPOINT VALUES AND DERIVATIVES OF THE OUTPUTS WITH
#	RESPECT TO CSM MASS BEING CALCULATED PRIOR TO CALCULATION OF THE OUTPUTS.  (2) OTHERWISE, THE OUTPUTS CAN BE
#	CALCULATED USING PREVIOUSLY COMPUTED BREAKPOINT VALUES AND DERIVATIVES.
#
# CALLING SEQUENCES
#
#	IF LEM MASS OR CONFIGURATION HAS BEEN UPDATED, TRANSFER TO MASSPROP, OTHERWISE TRANSFER TO FIXCW.
#		L	TC	BANKCALL or IBNKCALL
#		L+1	CADR	MASSPROP
#			OR
#		L+1	CADR	FIXCW
#		L+2	RETURNS VIA Q
#
# CALLED:  IN PARTICULAR BY DONOUN47 (JOB) AND TVCEXECUTIVE (TASK)
#
# JOBS OR TASKS INITIATED:  NONE
#
# SUBROUTINES CALLED:  NONE
#
# ERASABLE INITIALIZATION REQUIRED
#
#	LEMMASS MUST CONTAIN LEM MASS SCALED AT B+16 KILOGRAMS
#	CSMMASS MUST CONTAIN CSM MASS SCALED AT B+16 KILOGRAMS
#	DAPDATR1 MUST BE SET TO INDICATE VEHICLE CONFIGURATION.
#		BITS (15,14,13)  =  ( 0 , 0 , 1 )	LEM OFF
#				    ( 0 , 1 , 0 )	LEM ON (ASCNT,DSCNT)
#				    ( 1 , 1 , 0 )	LEM ON (ASCNT ONLY)
#
# ALARMS:  NONE
#
# EXIT:		TC	Q
#
# OUTPUTS:
#
#	(1)	IXX, SINGLE PRECISION SCALED AT B+20 IN KG-M SQ.
#	(2)	IAVG, SINGLE PRECISION SCALED AT B+20 IN KG-M SQ.
#	(3)	IAVG/TLX, SINGLE PRECISION, SCALED AT B+2 SEC-SQD
#
#	THEY ARE STORED IN CONSECUTIVE REGISTERS IXX0, IXX1, IXX2
#	CONVERSION FACTOR:  (SLUG-FTSQ) = 0.737562 (KG-MSQ)
# Page 952
#
# OUTPUTS ARE CALCULATED AS FOLLOWS:
#
#	(1)	IF LEM DOCKED, LEMMASS IS FIRST ELIMINATED AS A PARAMETER
#
#		VARST0 = INTVALUE0 + LEMMASS(SLOPEVAL0)		IXX		BREAKPOINT VALUE
#		VARST1 = INTVALUE1 + LEMMASS(SLOPEVAL1)		IAVG		BREAKPOINT VALUE
#		VARST2 = INTVALUE2 + LEMMASS(SLOPEVAL2)		IAVG/TLX	BREAKPOINT VALUE
#
#		VARST3 = INTVALUE3 + LEMMASS(SLOPEVAL3)		IAVG/TLX	SLOPE FOR CSMMASS > 33956 LBS (SPS > 10000 LBS)
#		VARST4 = INTVALUE4 + LEMMASS(SLOPEVAL4)		IAVG		SLOPE FOR CSMMASS > 33956 LBS (SPS > 10000 LBS)
#
#		VARST5 = INTVALUE5 + LEMMASS(SLOPEVAL5)		IXX		SLOPE FOR ALL VALUES OF CSMMASS
#
#		VARST6 = INTVALUE6 + LEMMASS(SLOPEVAL6)		IAVG		SLOPE FOR CSMMASS < 33956 LBS (SPS < 10000 LBS)
#		VARST7 = INTVALUE7 + LEMMASS(SLOPEVAL7)		IAVG/TLX	SLOPE FOR CSMMASS < 33956 LBS (SPS < 10000 LBS)
#
#		VARST8 = INTVALUE8 + LEMMASS(SLOPEVAL8)		IAVG		DECREMENT TO BRKPT VALUE WHEN LEM DSCNT STAGE OFF
#		VARST9 = INTVALUE9 + LEMMASS(SLOPEVAL9)		IAVG/TLX	DECREMENT TO BRKPT VALUE WHEN LEM DSCNT STAGE OFF
#
#	(2)	IF LEM NOT DOCKED
#
#		VARST0 = NOLEMVAL0	WHERE THE MEANING AND SCALING OF VARST0
#			.		TO VARST9 ARE THE SAME AS GIVEN ABOVE
#			.
#			.		NOTE... FOR THIS CASE, VARST8,9 HAVE NO
#		VARST9 = NOLEMVAL9	MEANING (THEY ARE COMPUTED BUT NOT USED)
#
# 	(3)	THE FINAL OUTPUT CALCULATIONS ARE THEN DONE
#
#		IXX0 = VARST0 + (CSMMASS + NEGBPW)VARST5		IXX
#
#		IXX1 = VARST1 + (CSMMASS + NEGBPW)VARST(4 OR 6)		IAVG
#
#		IXX2 = VARST2 + (CSMMASS + NEGBPW)VARST(3 OR 7)		IAVG/TLX
#
# 	THE DATA USED CAME FROM THE CSM/LM SPACECRAFT OPERATIONAL DATA BOOK
#		VOL. 3, NASA DOCUMENT SNA-8-D-027 (MARCH 1968)
#
# 	PERTINENT MASS DATA:		CSM WEIGHT	(FULL)	64100 LBS.
#							(EMPTY)	23956 LBS.
#					LEM WEIGHT	(FULL)	32000 LBS.
#							(EMPTY)	14116 LBS.
