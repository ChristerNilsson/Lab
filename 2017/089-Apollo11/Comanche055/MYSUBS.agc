# This source code has been transcribed or otherwise adapted from digitized
# images of a hardcopy from the MIT Museum.  The digitization was performed
# by Paul Fjeld, and arranged for by Deborah Douglas of the Museum.  Many
# thanks to both.  The images (with suitable reduction in storage size and
# consequent reduction in image quality as well) are available online at
# www.ibiblio.org/apollo.  If for some reason you find that the images are
# illegible, contact me at info@sandroid.org about getting access to the
# (much) higher-quality images which Paul actually created.
