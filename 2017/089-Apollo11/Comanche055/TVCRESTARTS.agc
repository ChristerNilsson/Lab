# NAME....TVCRESTART PACKAGE, CONSISTING OF REDOTVC, ENABL1, 2, CMDSOUT, PHSCHK2, ETC.
# LOG SECTION....TVCRESTARTS			SUBROUTINE....DAPCSM
# MODIFIED BY SCHLUNDT				21 OCTOBER 1968
#
# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION....
#
#      *RESTART-PROCESS THE TVC DAPS, INCLUDING PITCHDAP, YAWDAP,
#	TVCEXECUTIVE, ROLLDAP, TVCINIT4, TVCDAPON, AND CSM/.M V46 SWTCHOVR.
#
#      *TVC RESTARTS DESERVE SPECIAL CONSIDERATION IN SEVERAL AREAS.
#	RESTART DOWN-TIME IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE TRANSIENTS INTRODUCED
#	BY THE THRUST VECTOR RETURN TO THE ACTUATOR MECHANICAL NULLS
#	FOLLOWING TVC- AND OPTICS-ERROR-COUNTER-DISENABLES (CHANNEL 12).
#	TVC USES A MIXTURE OF WAITLIST, T5, T6, AND JOB CALLS.  THERE IS
#	FILTER MEMORY (UP TO 6TH ORDER) TO BE PROTECTED IF WILD TRANSIENTS
#	ARE TO BE AVOIDED.  COUNTERS ARE INVOLVED FOR ONE-SHOT
#	CORRECTIONS AND GAIN UPDATES.  THE GIMBAL TRIM ESTIMATORS AND THE
#	BODY AXIS ATTITUDE ERROR INTEGRATORS INVOLVE DIGITAL SUMMATION.
#	DIGITAL DIFFERENTIATORS ARE INVOLVED IN THE BODY AXIS RATE ESTIMA-
#	TIONS AND IN THE OUTPUTTING OF ACTUATOR COMMANDS.  THERE IS AN
#	OFFSET-TRACKER-FILTER TO PROTECT.  ETC., ETC.
#
#      *THOSE QUANTITIES WHICH MUST BE PROTECTED ARE STORED IN TEMPORARY
#	REGISTERS AS THEY ARE COMPUTED, FOR UPDATING THE REAL REGISTERS
#	DURING COPYCYCLES.
#
#      *THE SEVERAL COPYCYCLES ARE EACH PROTECTED BY PHASE POINTS AT THEIR
#	BEGINNING AND AT THEIR TERMINATION.  THE PHASE POINTS ARE SIMPLY
#	"INCR" INSTRUCTIONS, EITHER "INCR TVCEXPHS" FOR COPYCYCLES
#	IN THE TVCEXECUTIVE, OR "INCR TVCPHASE" FOR THE PITCH AND YAW
#	COPYCYCLES.  INDEXING ON EACH OF THESE POINTERS THEN PERMITS A
#	RETURN TO THE APPROPRIATE RESTART POINTS.
#
#      *IF A RESTART OCCURS DURING EITHER COPYCYCLE, THAT COPYCYCLE IS
#	COMPLETED.  THEN THE NORMAL TVCINIT4....DAPINIT....PITCHDAP STARTUP
#	SEQUENCE IS CALLED UPON TO GET THINGS GOING AGAIN.
#
#      *TVC-ENABLE AND OPTICS-ERROR-COUNTER ENABLE MUST BE SET ASAP
#	(ALLOWING FOR PROCEDURAL DELAYS).  THEN THE ENGINES ARE COMMANDED
#	TO THE P,YACTOFF TRIM VALUES.  THE DAPS ARE THEN READY TO GO ON THE
#	AIR, WITH THE REGULAR STARTUP SEQUENCE, EITHER AT MRCLEAN FOR A
#	COMPLETE INITIALIZATION OR AT TVCINIT4 FOR A PARTIAL INITIALIZATION.
#
#      *FOR RESTARTS PRIOR TO THE SETTING OF THE T5 BITS AT DOTVCON THE
#	PRE40.6 SECTION OF S40.6 TAKES CARE OF RE-ESTABLISHING TRIMS.
#
#      *IF A RESTART OCCURS DURING THE TVCEXEC....TVCEXFIN SEQUENCE THE
#	COMPUTATIONS WILL BE COMPLETED, STARTING AT THE APPROPRIATE RESTART
#	POINT, AFTER THE DAPS ARE READY TO GO ON THE AIR.
#
#      *IF A RESTART OCCURS PRIOR TO TVCINIT4 (TVCPHAS = -1) E.G. DURING
#	THE EARLY DAP INITIALIZATION PHASE, THE DAP STARTUP SEQUENCE IS
#	ENTERED AT MRCLEAN FOR A FULL INITIALIZATION.
#
#      *FOR RESTARTS DURING CSM/LM V46 SWITCH-VER, TVCPHASE IS SET TO -2.
#	AND THE RESTART LOGIC GOES BACK TO REDO SWITCH-OVER (AFTER THE
#	NORMAL DAP RESTART SEQUENCE IS FOLLOWED.)
#
#      *RESTARTS ARE NOT CRITICAL TO THE ROLL DAP PERFORMANCES HENCE THE
#	ROLL DAP IS MERELY RESTARTED.
#
#      *RESTARTS DURING A STROKE TEST (STROKER IS NON-ZERO) WILL CAUSE THE
# Page 957
#	STROKE TEST TO BE TERMINATED.  A NEW V68 ENTRY WILL BE REQUIRED
#	TO GET IT GOING AGAIN (NO AUTOMATIC RESTART).
#
#      *REDOTVC IS REACHED FOLLOWING ANY RESTART WHICH FINDS THE T5 BITS
#	(BITS 15,14 OF FLAGWRD6) SET FOR TVC.  DOTVCON TVCPHASE = -1
# 	AND TVC EXPHS = 0 JUST BEFORE SETTING THESE BITS, JUST BEFORE
#	MAKING THE T5 CALL TO TVCDAPON.  ON A NORMAL SHUTDOWN DOTVCRCS
#	CALLS RCSDAPON, WHICH RESETS THE T5 BIT FOR RCS
#
# CALLING SEQUENCE....T5, IN PARTICULAR BY ELRSKIP OF FRESH START/RESTART
#
# NORMAL EXIT MODES....RESUME, NOQRSM, POSTJUMP (TO TVCINIT4 OR MRCLEAN)
#
# ALARM OR ABORT EXIT MODES....NONE
#
# SUBROUTINES CALLED....
#
#      *PCOPY+1, YCOPY+1 (PITCH AND YAW COPYCYCLES)
#      *ENABLE1,2, CMDSOUT (RE-ESTABLISH ACTUATOR TRIMS)
#      *MRCLEAN OR TVCINIT4 (TVCDAP INITIALIZATIONS)
#      *SWITCHOVR +5 (CSM/LM V46 SWITCH-OVER)
#      *EXRSTRT AND TVCEXECUTIVE PHASE POINTS 1 THRU 6
#      *WAITLIST, IBNKCALL, POSTJUMP, ISWCALL
#
# OTHER INTERFACES....DOTVCON AND RCSDAPON (T5 BITS), ELRSKIP (CALLS IT)
#
# ERASABLE INITIALIZATION REQUIRED....
#
#      *T5 BITS (1,0), TVCPHASE (-2,-1,0,1,2,3), TVCEXPHS (1 THRU 6)
#      *TVC DAP VARIABLES
#      *OPERATIONS PERFORMED BY REDOTVC ARE BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT
#	THE TVC DAPS ARE RUNNING NORMALLY
#
# OUTPUT....
