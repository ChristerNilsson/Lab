# Asteroids Game Bot Live ([Demo](https://xviniette.github.io/AsteroidsLearning/))


##Overview
This is a JS app demod by Siraj Raval in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2qVYpK6TPE) video on Youtube. that learns to avoid Asteroids using a technique called [Neuroevolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution). The operation is almost the same as [Flappy Learning](https://github.com/xviniette/FlappyLearning) with 16 sensors of distance all around the ship. We'll created neurons. Neurons are contained in layers. Layers are contained in Networks. Networks are contained in genomes. Genomes are contained in generations. There is an ever increasing set of abstractions, each ship tries and fails to increase it's score. We take the best ones and breed them for the next generation. The best genomes (with the best connections in it's neural network) will win. Survival of the fittest.
