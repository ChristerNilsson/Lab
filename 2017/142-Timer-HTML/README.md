# 142 Timer HTML

[Try it!](https://christernilsson.github.io/Lab/2017/142-Timer-HTML/index.html)

Improvements compared with iOS:

* No wheels. Just click on a digit to make it increment.
* Clear. Reset to 00:00:00

Otherwise, I have tried to maintain the same functionality.

* Colors
* Disable

## Comparison
