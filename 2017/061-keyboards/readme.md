### Keyboards

I'm using two Filcos from [The Keyboard Company(http://www.keyboardco.com)

To improve the visibility I bought one black and one yellow, and switched some keytops: F,J and characters not belonging to the alphabet or digits.

I also rearranged Delete, Insert and Home. Now Home is to the left of End and Delete is closer to Backspace.

Although I'm from Sweden I prefer the US keyboard layout.
Most European countries has a Programmers Keyboard. Sweden does not.
Å, Ä and Ö can be found with Alt + W, A and O.

The reason I changed was to make Comment Block work. Ctrl+/
No, just kidding.

The driver I'm using is EurKey, http://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/?lang=en
It gives me access to all european characters.

Editor: Sublime Text.
